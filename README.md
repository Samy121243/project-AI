##  Example 1: Knapsack Problem

###  Problem Description
The **Knapsack Problem** is a classic optimization problem in AI and Computer Science.

**Given:**
- A set of items, each with:
  - **Weight**
  - **Value**
- A knapsack with a **maximum weight capacity**

**Objective:**
- Select a subset of items such that:
  - The **total weight** does not exceed the knapsack capacity
  - The **total value** is **maximized**

---

###  Variants of the Knapsack Problem
- **0/1 Knapsack**  
  Each item can either be taken **once or not at all**
- **Fractional Knapsack**  
  Items can be taken partially (usually solved using greedy algorithms)

 *For search algorithms, the **0/1 Knapsack** is the most appropriate variant.*

---

###  Why This Problem?
The Knapsack Problem is ideal for demonstrating search algorithms because:

- ✔ Clearly defined **state space**
- ✔ Naturally forms a **decision tree**
- ✔ Highlights the difference between:
  - **Uninformed search**
  - **Informed (heuristic) search**
- ✔ It is **NP-hard**, making heuristics and optimization strategies essential

This allows teams to analyze:
- Solution quality
- Time complexity
- Memory usage

## 🔄 Project Workflow – Knapsack Problem

### 1️⃣ Define the Problem Inputs
- Specify:
  - Knapsack capacity
  - List of items (weight & value)

### 2️⃣ Initialize the Solution Structure
- Create a data structure (e.g., **Dynamic Programming table**) to store:
  - Maximum achievable value for each capacity

### 3️⃣ Iterate Over the Items
- Process items one by one

### 4️⃣ Check the Weight Constraint
- Ensure the item’s weight does not exceed the current capacity

### 5️⃣ Apply the Knapsack Decision Rule
Compare two cases:
-  Excluding the item
-  Including the item and adding its value to the remaining capacity’s best solution

### 6️⃣ Update the DP Table
- Store the maximum value obtained from the comparison

### 7️⃣ Construct the Optimal Solution
- The final cell of the table contains the **maximum achievable value**

### 8️⃣ Trace Back Selected Items (Optional)
- Determine which items were chosen to reach the optimal value

### 9️⃣ Display the Result
- Output:
  - Maximum total value
  - Selected items (if required)

---

## 📦 Expected Deliverables
- Source code for each search algorithm
- Comparative analysis of algorithm performance
- Output showing:
  - Optimal value
  - Selected items
- Documentation explaining:
  - Algorithm behavior
  - Time and space complexity

---

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how different **search algorithms** approach the same optimization problem, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and real-world trade-offs in AI problem-solving.
